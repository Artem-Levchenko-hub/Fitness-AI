"""Internal API for project runtime lifecycle.

All endpoints below are gated by `X-Internal-Token` header verified against
`Settings.internal_token`. They are meant for apps/api (the public-facing
FastAPI service) to call; web clients never touch this surface.

These handlers are fully implemented and live in production: provision/wake/
stop/status, hot-reload, compile + runtime status, and a real prod deploy
(build image → run durable container → health-poll → nginx vhost + TLS). The
contracts (request/response schemas) are stable and consumed by apps/api today.
