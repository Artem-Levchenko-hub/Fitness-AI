"""Contract + drift guard for the brief-narration script shipped in the two
flagship Next.js container templates (ONE BRIEF, EVERY SURFACE).

Why these pins matter: the art-director brief is the single source of design
truth, but it used to reach ONLY the workspace chat — entity dashboards and the
public «/» were born silent. This script turns the brief (forwarded by the
workspace over `postMessage({type:'omnia:brief'})`, or baked onto
`window.__omniaBrief`) into a short "AI is designing" reveal on the surface
itself. A regression that drops the message listener, breaks the brief→lines
logic, or unwires the layout silently re-mutes every generated app. These are
deterministic file-content asserts (same house style as the inspector / remix
drift guards) — money-free, no container needed.
