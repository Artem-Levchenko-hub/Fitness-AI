"""Acceptance-lock for BS-21 (dogfood run #18, 2026-06-16): sorting a generated
entity list returns the extremum of the NEWEST ~50 rows, not of the full dataset
— so "sort by price / due / amount" gives a confidently WRONG top result.

The engine ALREADY has a correct, typed, server-side sort:
  - `listRecords` reads `sort` / `order` from the query (engine.ts:180-181), and
  - `fieldExpr` casts the jsonb value before ordering — `::numeric` for number
    fields, `::timestamptz` for date fields (engine.ts:74-75) — so the server
    orders the WHOLE table correctly (numbers numerically, dates chronologically).

But the managed list never uses it. `<CrudResource>` makes every column sortable
by default (crud-resource.tsx:168), a header click calls `toggleSort` which sets
CLIENT-side sort state (data-table.tsx:363), and the table re-sorts its already
-loaded `rows` prop in memory (data-table.tsx:305-307). Those rows are the ≤50
`useEntity` loaded with one `list()` call that pushes NO `sort`/`order` — the hook
explicitly defers sort to the client table (use-entity.ts:21). So the column-header
sort only ever orders the newest ~50 rows (created_at DESC default page); the global
extremum, if it lives outside that window, can never reach the top.

LIVE PROOF (run #18, throwaway container from the deployed base image
`omnia-template-nextjs-entities:dev`, project dogfood-sortcap-probe-1bb521,
container omnia-dev-dogfood-sortcap-probe-1bb521 port 3302, starter `Task` entity,
owner-auth via Auth.js credentials — no LLM, no gen):
  - Seeded 55 `Task`; the OLDEST-created is "AAA-EARLIEST-DUE-MARK" with
    due 2018-01-01
    (the global earliest); the 54 filler tasks all have 2026-* dues.
  - GET /api/entities/Task (no params — exactly what useEntity sends)
        → 50 rows, MARK ABSENT;
        the earliest `due` present in that loaded window is 2026-01-15
        → the BEST a client-side "sort by due ↑" can show as TOP is 2026-01-15.
  - GET ?sort=due&order=asc&limit=200 (engine server-sort, full set)
        → TOP = MARK, due 2018-01-01
  - GET ?sort=due&order=asc (engine server-sort, DEFAULT 50-cap)
        → TOP = MARK, due 2018-01-01,
        MARK PRESENT — i.e. the server sorts the WHOLE table THEN takes the top 50,
        so pushing sort to the server surfaces the true extremum even at the cap.
  - GET ?limit=200 (control) → 55 rows, MARK present.

So the engine returns the right answer (2018-01-01) when ASKED to sort; the managed
UI never asks, and a user clicking "Срок ↑" to find the most overdue task sees
2026-01-15 and believes it is the earliest. Worse than the BS-18 silent truncation
(rows merely hidden) and the BS-20 false absence (search says "not found"): a sort
returns a wrong row that LOOKS authoritative, with no count/empty cue.

Distinct from its siblings:
  - BS-18 (P-PAGINATE): records 51+ are unreachable. SORT is a different operation
    that produces a misleading WRONG top rather than just hiding rows.
  - BS-20 (P-SEARCH): there is NO server text-search primitive to push a query to.
    Here the server sort primitive EXISTS and even works at the 50-cap (proof above)
    — the gap is purely that the managed read path does not push `sort`/`order`.
Family: BS-14 / BS-16 / BS-18 / BS-20 — a visible control (here, the sortable column
header) implies the whole set is reachable when only the loaded window is.

Class wider than CRM: any growing list with an ordered column — orders by amount,
invoices by due date, products by price, leads by created date, students by grade.

Why this is a PROPOSAL, not a blind ship (→ P-SORT):
  - The fix wires the DataTable's sort state into useEntity's server params (push
    `sort`/`order`, reusing the existing engine sort) so the header sort orders the
    full table. It is small and reuses a built primitive, BUT it is a TEMPLATE change
    → base-image rebuild on prod + regen-verify, it changes the list data-flow
    contract for every generated app (a header click now triggers a server fetch with
    loading state), and it is tightly coupled to BS-18/BS-20 (the same client-side
    ≤50 window) — fixing sort alone while search/pagination stay client-side is
    inconsistent. Best landed together with P-PAGINATE as one read-path refactor.
  - Live-gen is currently WALLET-blocked, so a regenerated app cannot be verified
    end-to-end this run. Min one fix per run, no blind template ship.

Deterministic file-content asserts (money-free, no container, no LLM).
