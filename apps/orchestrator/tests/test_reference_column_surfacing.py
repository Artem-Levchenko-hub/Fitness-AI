"""Acceptance-lock for BS-16 (dogfood run #13, 2026-06-16): a list of records
that belong to a parent can ship with the parent INVISIBLE in the list, because
`<CrudResource>` auto-EXPANDS reference fields but never auto-RENDERS a column
for them — and no SYSTEM_PROMPT directive requires the relation to be shown.

What IS healthy (verified, not the bug): the relation *picker* on create/edit.
Two independent real prod sandboxes confirm the writer correctly maps a
schema `reference` field to a populated `<Select>`:
  - dogfood-crm-verify-2a9337  Booking.clientId / Note.clientId
      → fields=[{name:"clientId", kind:"reference", refEntity:"Client", …}]
  - dogfood-dent-crm-bdc3f3    Appointment.patientId / .doctorId
      → fields=[{… kind:"reference", refEntity:"Patient"/"Doctor"}]
and EntityForm loads options via entities[refEntity].list({limit:200}) and
renders SelectItems (entity-form.tsx:96-120,291-313). No UUID text box. Good.

What is NOT healthy (the blind spot): surfacing the relation in the LIST. The
two sandboxes diverge under the SAME generator — pure writer variance:
  - dent-crm appointments/page.tsx — columns render the related name:
      {key:"patientId", header:"Пациент", render:(r)=>(r._expanded?.patientId)?.name ?? "—"}
      {key:"doctorId",  header:"Лечащий врач", render:(r)=>{const d=r._expanded?.doctorId …}}
    → you can see WHOSE appointment each row is.  ✓
  - crm-verify bookings/page.tsx — columns = Дата/Время/Услуга/Стоимость/Статус.
    clientId is in `fields` (the form) but is NOT a column. The booking list
    never shows the client → "whose booking is this?" is unanswerable in-list.
  - crm-verify notes/page.tsx ("Текстовые примечания к клиентам") — columns =
    Текст/Дата создания. clientId is not a column. A notes-ABOUT-clients screen
    that never shows the client.

Root cause (code-proven, no live container):
  - crud-resource.tsx:171-184 auto-expands reference fields into list params
    (`expand = fields.filter(f => f.kind === "reference").map(f => f.name)`),
    so `row._expanded.<ref>` IS fetched on every list call.
  - crud-resource.tsx:168 the column list is taken from props verbatim (only a
    `sortable` default is added); nothing ever derives a column from the
    reference fields. The auto-expanded data is silently thrown away whenever
    the writer omits the column.
  - SYSTEM_PROMPT.md has NO directive requiring a `reference` field to appear as
    a list column, so the writer is free to drop it (and sometimes does).

Class wider than CRM: any feed of records owned by a parent (order→customer,
ticket→project, appointment→patient, note→client) can ship a list where the
parent is invisible while the create form captures it fine.

Why this is a PROPOSAL, not a blind ship: the clean deterministic fix —
CrudResource auto-appends a column for each reference field not already present
in `columns`, rendering `_expanded[name]?.name ?? "—"` — is a TEMPLATE change
(requires a base-image rebuild on prod) and must be regen-verified across niches
(a writer could legitimately omit a self-referential/secondary ref). Min one
fix per run, no blind template ship. → PROPOSAL P-REFCOL.

These are deterministic file-content asserts (money-free, no container, no LLM).
