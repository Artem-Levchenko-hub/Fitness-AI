"""Acceptance-lock for BS-9 (dogfood run #7, 2026-06-16): the entity runtime
has NO multi-role / RBAC model, so a multi-actor app whose actors need
DIFFERENT views (school journal, clinic doctor/patient, marketplace
buyer/seller) is structurally impossible — the art-director brief designs
per-role access policies the engine can neither express nor enforce.

Scenario: a real prod prompt — «Полноценное веб-приложение для школы №7:
… личные кабинеты для трёх ролей — ученик, родитель и учитель (учитель
ставит оценки, ученик и родитель только смотрят)». Sandbox
dogfood-school-zhurnal-da6a5c (template escalated blank→nextjs_entities ✓).

The AD brief (02_brief.md) faithfully modelled three roles with compound
access:
  - Student      — access: admin/teacher (write), parent/student (read)
  - JournalEntry — access: teacher (write), student/parent (read-own)
  - Parent       — access: admin (write), parent (read)   [field: phone]
But `AccessPolicy` is only `owner | public | admin` (registry.ts:46), so the
writer was forced to FLATTEN every compound spec into one of three buckets
(03_writer_raw.html):
  - Student, Teacher, Parent, Lesson, Homework, Announcement → "public"
  - JournalEntry → "owner"

Two live failures, proven against the running sandbox:

1. PRIVACY LEAK. A `public` entity is readable by ANYONE incl. anonymous
   (engine.ts:60-61: public read = open, never owner-scoped). Live:
       GET https://…-da6a5c-dev.preview…/api/entities/Parent  → HTTP 200
       {"data":[{"phone":"+7 (993) 584-93-56","fullName":"Мария Соколова",…}]}
   Parent phone numbers (personal data) served to the open internet, no auth.
   The AD's intent "Parent — read by the *parent* role" collapsed to "public =
   everyone on earth" because there is no narrower role to map it to.

2. CORE FEATURE DEAD. `JournalEntry` → "owner" → every read scoped to
   `created_by` (engine.ts:166-169). The teacher (first signup = the only
   "admin", auth.ts:149) creates the grades. A parent or student is just role
   "user", owner-scoped to rows THEY created → they read an EMPTY journal and
   can never see the child's grades. Live: anon `GET /api/entities/JournalEntry`
   → 401; a logged-in non-creator gets `[]`. "Ученик и родитель только смотрят"
   is unreachable.

Root cause (all code-proven, no LLM variance):
  - registry.ts:46  AccessPolicy = "owner" | "public" | "admin"  (3 modes only)
  - registry.ts:107-108  normalize() coerces any other access value → "owner"
  - auth.ts:149  roleForNewUser() mints only "admin" | "user" — no teacher /
    student / parent role can ever exist, so a role-conditional control like the
    brief's «кнопка "Выставить оценку" только для роли "Учитель"» can never fire.
  - engine.ts authorize() only ever checks `user.role !== "admin"`.

The fix — real per-app roles + a role-assignment UX + relationship-based
"read-own" scoping (parent → their child) — spans engine + registry + auth +
role-assignment UI (apps/web, cross-zone) + writer prompt, and is
security-sensitive. → PROPOSAL P-RBAC, NOT a blind ship.

These are deterministic file-content asserts (money-free, no container).
