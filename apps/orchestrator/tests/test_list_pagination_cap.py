"""Acceptance-lock for BS-18 (dogfood run #15, 2026-06-16): a generated entity
list silently caps at the engine's DEFAULT_LIMIT (50 rows) — the managed
`<CrudResource>` screen never requests a higher `limit` and never wires
server-side pagination, so any list that grows past 50 records drops the
overflow with NO error, NO "load more", and NO indication. The DataTable's own
pager paginates ONLY the ≤50 rows already in memory, which makes the list look
complete (e.g. "5 pages of 10") while ~10% of the data is unreachable.

LIVE PROOF (run #15, throwaway container from the deployed base image
`omnia-template-nextjs-entities:dev`, project dogfood-listcap-probe-cd7c7c,
starter `Task` entity, owner-auth via Auth.js credentials — no LLM, no gen):
  - Created 55 `Task` records (#1..#55).
  - GET /api/entities/Task (no limit — what useEntity/CrudResource sends)
        → 50 rows: #6..#55
  - GET /api/entities/Task?limit=200 (below the engine MAX_LIMIT)
        → 55 rows: #1..#55
  - GET /api/entities/Task?page=2 → 5 rows: #1..#5
The 5 OLDEST records (#1..#5) are absent from the default list (default sort is
created_at DESC). The engine CAN page (page=2 returns the rest) — the managed UI
just never asks. So the gap is purely a wiring gap, not a server limitation.

Root cause (code-proven):
  - engine.ts: DEFAULT_LIMIT = 50, MAX_LIMIT = 500; listRecords clamps to
    `Number(limit) || DEFAULT_LIMIT` → 50 when the caller sends no `limit`.
  - use-entity.ts: loads the collection with ONE `entities[name].list(params)`
    call (params passed verbatim), reloads after each mutation, and never sets
    `limit`/`page`/`offset` nor loops pages. Its own comment: "client-side
    search/sort/paging happen in <DataTable>, not here."
  - crud-resource.tsx: `mergedParams` only injects `expand`; no default `limit`.
    The DataTable receives `rows={data.rows}` (the ≤50 already fetched) and
    paginates them client-side via `pageSize` — it never refetches a server page.
  - SYSTEM_PROMPT.md lists `entities.X.list({sort,order,limit,page})` as
    available but never directs the writer to wire pagination, and CrudResource
    is the documented "fast path for any list screen" — so the 50-cap is the
    default for virtually every generated managed list.

Class wider than CRM: any growing collection — clients, orders, products,
bookings, leads, students, messages — silently truncates at 50. Same family as
BS-14 (unreachable feed cards) and BS-16 (invisible reference column): the
generator surfaces only part of the data while looking complete.

Why this is a PROPOSAL, not a blind ship (→ P-PAGINATE):
  - The minimal band-aid (default the managed fetch to `limit: 500` = MAX_LIMIT)
    is a TEMPLATE change → base-image rebuild on prod + regen-verify, and it
    only MOVES the cliff (>500 still vanishes) while making every managed
    screen fetch 500 rows + their ref-expansions on every load.
  - The correct fix is real server pagination: the engine returns a total/has-
    more, useEntity exposes page state and refetches, and the DataTable pager
    drives it — multi-surface, changes the list data-flow contract. Larger/risky.
  - Min one fix per run, no blind template ship.

Deterministic file-content asserts (money-free, no container, no LLM).
