/**
 * Auth.js (NextAuth v5) configuration — pre-wired with the Drizzle adapter
 * and a Credentials (email + password) provider so generated apps can
 * sign users in out of the box. AI doesn't need to touch this file —
 * extending session shape or adding OAuth providers happens here.
 *
 * Architecture:
 * - Session strategy: `jwt` (required by the Credentials provider — Auth.js
 *   rejects a credentials sign-in under the `database` strategy). The token
 *   carries id + role and expires 30 days from sign-in; rotate AUTH_SECRET to
 *   revoke everyone.
 * - Password hashing: bcryptjs (10 rounds). The hash lives in
 *   `users.passwordHash`; the plaintext password NEVER reaches the DB.
 * - `auth.config.ts` would split edge-vs-node concerns if the project
 *   ever needs middleware-level auth. Today middleware uses cookie
 *   probing, see `src/middleware.ts`.
 *
 * The orchestrator injects two env vars on container start:
 * - `AUTH_SECRET` — used by Auth.js for session token signing. Generated
 *   per-project at provision time; rotation invalidates all sessions.
 * - `DATABASE_URL` — already documented elsewhere.
 *
 * Adding a new OAuth provider:
 * 1. `pnpm add` the relevant `@auth/<provider>` package
 * 2. Import the provider here, add to `providers[]`
 * 3. Set the provider's CLIENT_ID / CLIENT_SECRET env vars
 * The `accounts` table already supports any provider Auth.js ships.
