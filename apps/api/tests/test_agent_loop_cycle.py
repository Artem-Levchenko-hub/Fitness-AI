"""Cycle breaker for the agentic loop — the no-WRITE streak guard.

Regression for the live bug: the agent looped on read-only actions
(read→grep→list→read→read) for the whole 80-step budget, writing ZERO files.
The consecutive-identical circuit breaker missed it (each step differs from the
last). The no-WRITE streak guard must catch a multi-step read CYCLE, nudge to
write, and abort early instead of burning the budget — while NOT tripping a real
build that reads a couple files before writing.
