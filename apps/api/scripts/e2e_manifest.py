"""PAID-RUN MANIFEST — the one staged harness that folds EVERY accumulated proof
against ONE live stream per niche, with a unified PASS/FAIL and per-niche WOW
subscore (v2.13 keystone).

The problem this solves (the NORTH-STAR gap, named by six review lenses): the
whole visible/viral/causality layer — narration (V3.10), brief swatches (V3.4),
joy (V3.8), chip→pixel (V2.5b), fork param-inherit (V4.2b), fork lineage (V4.7),
viral-eligibility (V4.9, the pillar-1→4 floor bridge), the eight
composition/quality gates (``accept_gauntlet``) — shipped as *isolated*
money-free unit-proofs. Each is green in a vacuum; none has ever been composed
into ONE live chain and watched play out. A unit gate cannot catch the cross-cut
regression (narration lags the render / swatches desync from the painted page /
the chip gate trips on an edge palette / a fork drops its seed param) because no
unit gate sees the whole performance at once.

This manifest is that single chain. The owner runs it ONCE at flip time: it
drives 5–6 niches end-to-end, folds every proof against the same stream, captures
a screenshot per stage, and prints a unified verdict — instant visibility of the
*entire* product in one pass.

MONEY-FREE BY CONSTRUCTION. The scaffold makes NO LLM call and opens NO browser.
The two expensive halves are SEAMS:

  * the per-niche ``GauntletVerdict`` (the gate proofs) is *injected* on the
    :class:`ManifestObservation`. The owner produces it at flip time from a real
    generation via ``accept_gauntlet.run(url=...)``; the shipped
    :func:`mock_observation` produces a deterministic synthetic verdict so the
    harness, its parser, and the unified fold are all testable today.
  * the screenshot/video grab is a :data:`CaptureFn`. The shipped
    :func:`null_capture` returns a synthetic ref and touches nothing; the owner
    plugs a Playwright capture into the same seam at flip time.

So the structure ships and is ratcheted now; only the stream behind it is paid.

Canon: R-01 (one ``run_manifest`` hides parse + per-niche fold + capture), R-04
(reuses ``accept_gauntlet`` verdicts/gate-ids and ``niche_batch.CORPUS`` — no new
gate, no new corpus, every proof's truth still lives in its own module), R-10
(a missing verdict / uncaptured field ABSTAINS — no evidence is never a pass, but
a flaky capture never crashes the run).

SECURITY (audited before the owner-run, per the manifest brief): the scaffold is
a pure fold and reaches no network. The only owner-facing attack surface is the
target URL the real capture seam will fetch — :func:`assert_safe_target` is the
guard that path MUST call (http(s) only, no embedded credentials, no control
chars → no SSRF via ``file://``/``gopher://``, no token-leak via ``user:pass@``),
and :func:`_safe_ref` sanitises every capture ref so a niche/stage name can never
traverse out of an output directory. Both are unit-tested.

# ── Frozen dress-rehearsal (V-MANIFEST-FROZEN: deterministic, 0 LLM, 0 browser) ─
#
# The mock stream above proves the FOLD is sound, but it never reads a real page —
# its verdict is synthesised. This frozen mode folds the manifest over the four
# committed enterprise snapshots in ``reference_corpus_data/{agency,ecommerce,
# editorial,saas}.html`` (R-04 — the same corpus the reference ceiling leg uses),
# so the dress-rehearsal runs against REAL static HTML deterministically and
# browser-free. The owner-run later swaps these static files for a live
# generation + browser capture; the structure, fold and teeth are exercised now.
#
# Honesty contract — every gate is accounted for, none is faked:
#   * defect-registry + compose + the four context registries (viral/onboarding/
#     render/edit) are the REAL ``accept_gauntlet`` gates, run browser-free over
#     the actual HTML via ``run(..., include_rendered=False)``. No surrogate.
#   * the rendered legs cannot render without a browser, so in frozen mode they
#     are STATIC SURROGATES derived from the page's real structure (taste,
#     hierarchy, wow-dom, perf-a11y carry teeth; chip-pixel/data/reference are
#     documented inert/seam passes). Each surrogate's subscore is tagged
#     ``frozen=True`` so its provenance is never mistaken for a live render — the
#     owner-run replaces them with ``accept_gauntlet.run(url=...)``.
# An adversary that defaces a corpus file (flattens type, strips the hero, blanks
# the palette, injects a dead-auth CTA, drops the a11y landmarks) flips the gate
# it touches AND the unified verdict — the rehearsal has teeth, it is not a
# vacuous green over pre-vetted files.
