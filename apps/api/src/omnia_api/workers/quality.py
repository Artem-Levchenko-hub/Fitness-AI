"""RQ job: composition-gauntlet an entity/fullstack app's LIVE container.

V1.6 16/5. Freeform / catalog pages run the composition floor inline in the API
process (``acceptance.evaluate`` renders a static ``files`` dict). Entity /
fullstack apps can't: they live in a Docker container reachable only on the
``omnia-runtime`` network, and only the WORKER joins that network (the API
process is on ``omnia-prod`` only). So the live-container composition gate runs
HERE, in the worker, where Playwright can reach ``omnia-dev-<slug>:3000``
container-to-container — the same path the preview-thumbnail job already uses.

Enqueued right after a clean hot-reload (``enqueue_entity_gate``). It waits for
Turbopack to settle (a compile-broken app is surfaced separately by the API's
compile probe — we skip it here), fans the COMPOSITION_LEGS over the live URL,
and surfaces a ``hard_failed`` as a quality card on the assistant message.

Fully fail-soft (R-10): any hiccup — unreachable container, compile still
broken, render error — skips the card. A missing quality card is acceptable; a
broken build is not.
