"""Pydantic schemas for V2 runtime/deploy endpoints.

These mirror the public TypeScript types in
`apps/web/src/lib/api/types.ts` (RuntimeStatus / DeployStatus) so the
api/web contract stays in sync. Bigger orchestrator payloads (e.g. logs
URL, image digest) are intentionally NOT in the public response — they
live inside the internal contract between api and orchestrator.
