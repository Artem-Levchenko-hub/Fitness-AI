"""Anti-generic originality fingerprint (Phase 11, Sprint 4).

Goal: raise the *spread between sites*. We fingerprint every accepted freeform
page (a 64-bit perceptual dHash of its screenshot) into a global pool, and when
a new page comes out near-identical to a DIFFERENT project's page we feed that
back as a repair issue ("make a genuinely different composition"). Similarity
to the SAME project is expected (iterative editing) and never penalised.

Everything fails SOFT (R-10): no Pillow, no Redis, or a decode error → no
fingerprint and no penalty, so generation never breaks on this signal.
