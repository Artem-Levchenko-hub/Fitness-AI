"""Objective taste-floor gate — the awwwards PROMISE, machine-checked (V1.6 7/5).

The four gates that landed before this one (``defect_registry``, ``wow_dom_gate``,
``perf_a11y_gate``, ``chip_pixel_gate``) are *correctness / safety floors*: no
dead anchor, no h-scroll, AA contrast, fast, screen-reader-usable, request↔output
fidelity. A bland, perfectly-correct page passes every one of them — a flat
Bootstrap template clears them clean. That is exactly the hole pillar 1 of the
NORTH STAR forbids: "every generated app looks awwwards/enterprise from the FIRST
generation." The retired ``vision`` verdict used to guard taste as a vibe; this
module replaces the vibe with an objective richness floor.

The five richness checks (each worth one point; the gate FAILS below 4/5)
========================================================================
  1. ``font-pairing``   — ≥2 distinct primary font families (a display/body
                          pairing), OR a single CHOSEN webface worked across a
                          real weight range (display weight + body weight) — not
                          one flat system stack everywhere.
  2. ``type-scale``     — ≥3 distinct computed text sizes AND max/min ≥ 2.0
                          (a real typographic scale, not flat body copy).
  3. ``hierarchy``      — the above-the-fold composition has ONE dominant focal
                          element: the largest text is ≥1.8× the above-fold
                          median and is not tied by a crowd of equal headings.
  4. ``layout-variety`` — intentional rhythm: ≥2 distinct INNER content-column
                          widths, OR a full-bleed band (edge-to-edge hero image /
                          colour) alternating with contained content — not one
                          monotone column of cards. (Reads the inner content
                          column, not the outer full-width section rect.)
  5. ``hero-imagery``   — the hero region carries a real image (``<img>`` /
                          ``<svg>`` / ``<video>`` / ``background-image``), not a
                          solid colour plate.

Design — **JS extracts, Python scores** (R-01 deep module)
==========================================================
The injected ``_AUDIT_JS`` does *only* DOM extraction — font families, computed
sizes, element rects, per-section imagery — and returns raw numbers. Every
threshold and verdict lives in pure Python (:func:`evaluate_observation`), so the
whole rubric is unit-testable with a hand-built dict: no browser, no flake. The
async :func:`audit_files` / :func:`audit_url` wrappers are the only
browser-touching code and they fail soft (R-10): a render error yields
``rendered=False`` (the gate ABSTAINS) rather than raising into the caller.

Where the WOW-DOM gate scores a mobile floor at 390px, taste is a *composition*
concern best read where the layout breathes — so this gate's default viewport is
desktop (1440px). The acceptance gauntlet fans it at that width regardless of the
mobile width the correctness gates run at.
