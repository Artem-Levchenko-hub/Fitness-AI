"""Agent VISION tool — the engine behind the builder loop's `see` action.

Gives the agent real EYES: screenshot the live dev-container page it is building,
hand it to the same Awwwards-strict vision judge the acceptance gate uses
(`vision_audit`), and return concrete fix-deltas as the agent's observation. So
the agent stops being a blind author — it LOOKS at what it drew and fixes
"ugly"/"broken", not just "compiles".

Composes three existing pieces, adds nothing structural:
  dev_container.resolve_live_url  → where the running app lives
  preview.capture_live_url        → screenshot it (1440 + 360)
  vision_audit.audit_screenshots  → vision-model verdict + concrete issues

Fail-soft everywhere (R-10): no running preview, a render timeout, or a skipped
vision verdict all degrade to a harmless observation dict, never an exception
that could kill the loop.
