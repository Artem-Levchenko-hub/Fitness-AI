"""Defect-class registry — the deterministic ratchet of the acceptance gauntlet.

V1.6 slice 1/5. One read-only harness that scans a generated app's source files
for every generator-wide defect class we have ever fixed, and reports any that
reappear. Run it against a FRESH generation on each niche-E2E and on each change
to the generator; a clean (empty) report is what lets a V-task be marked done.

The point is anti-regression with TEETH: each closed defect lives here as ONE
deterministic assert (R-04 — knowledge in a single place, not re-described in
prose memory N times). Revert any past fix and the matching detector goes RED,
so a fix can never silently rot back in across niches. New niche surfaces a new
class → it MUST add a detector here (that is the "delta" a niche contributes).

Detection reuses the SAME constants the fix-guards use (``file_extractor``,
``palette_guard``, ``image_resolver``, ``lucide_icon_names``) so the registry and
the repair can never drift apart — there is exactly one definition of each
defect's shape. Every detector is pure, fail-soft (an unparseable file is
skipped, never raised), idempotent, and side-effect-free (R-10).

Two families of detector:

  * OUTPUT defects — present in the model's authored files (dead auth CTA,
    invalid/missing lucide import, misrouted kit import, invented palette var,
    empty catalog image). These fire on any file set, including the model's raw
    ``<file>`` answer.
  * KIT-INTEGRITY defects — a shipped kit capability was removed (the AppShell
    dark-theme prop, the globals.css hero-word-break rule, the popover surface
    tokens the sonner toast paints from). These fire only when the full
    provisioned app dir is scanned (the gauntlet's intended input); they no-op
    when the kit files aren't in the set.

Request↔output FIDELITY (did a dark-theme *request* actually reach the
dashboard) is deliberately out of scope here — that is the chip→pixel gate
(V1.6 slice 4/5 / V2.5), which has the discovery answers this registry doesn't.
