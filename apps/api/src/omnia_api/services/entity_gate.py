"""V1.6 16/5 — composition gauntlet on the LIVE entity / fullstack app.

Freeform / catalog pages ship as a static ``files`` dict and run through
``acceptance.evaluate`` (the freeform safety net + the always-on composition
legs, 14/5). Entity / fullstack apps are different: they build into a Docker
container served at ``http://omnia-dev-<slug>:3000`` on the shared runtime
network, and ``acceptance.evaluate`` *explicitly skips them*
(``messages.py`` filters ``_gen_mode in (freeform, catalog)``). So the
awwwards composition floor — taste + hierarchy, the heart of pillar 1 — was
asserted on ZERO entity apps, even though the whole pillar-1 corpus (clinic /
shop / CRM / school / fintech / fitness) is ``nextjs_entities``. The beauty
floor was gated on a branch the flagship barely uses.

This module closes that gap. After a clean hot-reload + compile-settle, the
caller fans the ``COMPOSITION_LEGS`` over the LIVE internal URL
(container-to-container, NO public egress) and surfaces a ``hard_failed`` as a
quality card — the live-container analog of a ship-block (the app is already
running, so the deterministic action is "regenerate", not "re-roll").

Canon: R-01 (one deep call hides URL-resolve + gauntlet + flag), R-04 (reuses
``dev_container.resolve_live_url`` and ``accept_gauntlet`` — no duplicated URL
math or gate logic), R-10 (fail-soft: unreachable / disabled / render error →
``None`` or an abstain, never a false hard-fail).

    """Run the composition legs (taste + hierarchy) against the live entity
    container and return the verdict.

    ``route`` (V1.6 16/5d) selects the surface to score — the caller resolves the
    WOW/content route via :mod:`route_target` and passes it here, so the gate
    scores the dashboard / landing rather than the bare ``/`` login wall. The
    default ``/`` keeps the historical behaviour.

    ``storage_state`` (Area C, DARK) is an authenticated Playwright session from
    :func:`auth_session.establish_session`. When present (the gate logged into the
    app), the gauntlet renders the REAL cabinet: it fans the composition floor at
    desktop AND an adaptive @390 pass (rich-on-desktop / monotone-on-mobile), plus
    the ADVISORY cabinet-states leg (empty-state / onboarding / stuck-skeleton).
    When ``None`` (flag off / login failed) behaviour is byte-identical to before —
    desktop composition on the resolved route, no cabinet leg, no @390.

    ``public_base`` (Area C, b2) is the app's CANONICAL https origin (its public
    preview host). When authenticated it MUST be used as the render base instead of
    the internal http url, because the session cookie is bound to that https host;
    the worker's browser reaches it via the host-resolver rule. Anonymous path
    ignores it and renders the internal url as before.

    Returns ``None`` (the caller skips the card this round) when the gate is
    disabled, the container isn't reachable, or the gauntlet errors. No ``files``
    are passed, so the source-scan registry leg is skipped — a container app has no
    static ``files`` dict here.
