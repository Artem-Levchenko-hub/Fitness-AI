"""Single-source render-settle helper for every gauntlet render leg (V1.6 13/5).

The ``domcontentloaded`` defect-class surfaced THREE separate times (preview 5.1,
hierarchy 9/5, latent taste 7/5) and was patched by hand each time — exactly the
recurrence the quality ratchet is supposed to make impossible. A generated app's
public ``/p/<slug>`` page is a Next.js client render: its hero, sections, accent
CTAs and colour land *after* ``load``, so reading at ``domcontentloaded`` sees an
empty shell — a false-FAIL on the strict streak and a hollow false-PASS on the
hot path.

Consolidating every leg onto one helper closes the class structurally (canon
R-04, single source of truth): the knowledge of "how to navigate to and settle a
client render" lives in exactly one place. No ``*_gate.py`` calls ``page.goto`` /
passes ``wait_until`` directly — the gate-suite AST assert
(``tests/test_render_settle.py``) fails the moment one tries. Helper is
unit-tested here once; each leg is asserted to route through it.

Every settle step is best-effort and never blocks the read (canon R-10): a flaky
network or font load degrades to a slightly earlier read, never a raise.
