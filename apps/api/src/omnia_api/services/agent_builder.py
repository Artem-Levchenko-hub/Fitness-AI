"""Agentic container-app builder — Phase 0 of the "like Claude Code" engine.

Today Omnia is a one-shot text generator: the model emits one blob, server
regex parses it into files, no feedback loop. This module is the opposite — a
real **agent loop**:

    plan -> act (a tool) -> observe the REAL result -> repeat -> verify -> done

It is a *text-protocol* ReAct loop, NOT native function-calling: the model
replies with reasoning followed by exactly ONE action in a strict
``<omnia:action name="...">{json}</omnia:action>`` block. The server parses it,
executes it against the live dev container, and feeds the real observation back
as the next user turn. This works with ANY gateway model (DeepSeek/Kimi/…) and
reuses Omnia's existing strength at parsing structured model output — no
dependency on the provider supporting OpenAI tool-calls.

Design rules that keep it safe to ship:
  * The EXECUTOR is injected (`execute` callable) so the loop is fully
    unit-testable with a fake — no container needed in tests.
  * Pure engine here; the production executor that talks to the orchestrator is
    `make_container_executor(...)` at the bottom.
  * Bounded: `max_steps` hard cap, per-action output truncation. No unbounded
    grind.
  * Gated by ``Settings.use_agentic_builder`` (default False) at the call site —
    when off, this module is never entered and current generation is untouched.

Actions (file tools + real build/runtime observations):
    list_dir     {"path": "src/app"}
    read_file    {"path": "src/app/page.tsx"}
    grep         {"pattern": "useState", "path": "src"}
    write_file   {"path": "...", "content": "...full file..."}
    edit_file    {"path": "...", "search": "...", "replace": "..."}
    build        {}                      # real typecheck/compile observation
    bash         {"cmd": "pnpm test"}    # arbitrary shell in the container
    read_logs    {}                      # live dev-server stdout/stderr (runtime errors)
    runtime_check{"path": "/"}           # hit a route, get the REAL HTTP status / crash file
    see          {"path": "/"}           # screenshot the live page → vision-model design critique
    done         {"summary": "what I built"}

`read_logs` + `runtime_check` + `see` give the loop EYES on the running app:
`build` proves it typechecks, `runtime_check`/`read_logs` prove it actually
renders, and `see` shows what it LOOKS like (vision judge → concrete design
fixes) — closing the gap between "compiles", "works" and "good-looking" (the
prototype-vs-real-product line).

THIS TEMPLATE (nextjs-entities) — already built for you, DO NOT rebuild or read its internals:
- A fixed ENTITY ENGINE turns JSON schemas into full CRUD+REST+auth+RBAC. You do NOT write \
backend/API/db code for PLAIN data — declare entities instead. But you MAY author \
CUSTOM server logic (a server action, or a route under src/app/api/custom/**) for \
real workflows BEYOND crud — reaching data ONLY through the SDK (@/lib/sdk) or the \
engine (@/lib/entities/engine), which enforce auth+ownership+membership. NEVER import \
@/lib/db, drizzle-orm or pg in your own files (that bypasses the access model and is \
rejected before ship). To add data, write `entities/<Name>.json`:
    {"name":"Client","label":"Клиент","labelPlural":"Клиенты",
     "fields":[{"name":"name","label":"Имя","type":"string","required":true},
               {"name":"phone","label":"Телефон","type":"string"},
               {"name":"car","label":"Авто","type":"string"}],
     "access":"admin"}
  field type ∈ {string,text,number,boolean,date,datetime,time,enum,reference}; \
for enum add "options":[...]; for reference add "ref":"<OtherEntity>". \
access ∈ {owner (per-user private), public (open read), admin (back-office)}. \
Back-office CRM data → "admin".
- SCREENS: write pages under `src/app/(app)/dashboard/`. For each entity, a page that renders \
`<CrudResource entity="Name" />` (from `@/components/omnia`) gives a full list+create+edit screen \
out of the box — read `src/components/omnia/crud-resource.tsx` ONCE to confirm its exact props, \
then write ALL the pages quickly. Pass ONLY `entity` (and an optional title) to \
<CrudResource> — it DERIVES the table columns + create/edit form from the entity schema, so \
values render automatically. Do NOT hand-build a table or pass custom column configs (that is \
what makes cells show "—"). Data SDK is `@/lib/sdk`, UI is `@/components/ui`, icons \
`lucide-react`. Auth/login, the dashboard shell, global CSS and the kit already exist — don't recreate them.
- ALWAYS write `src/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx` — the dashboard HOME (a short index with a \
card/link to each section). Without it, `/dashboard` is a 404 right after login. This is mandatory.

WORK STYLE (you have a LIMITED step budget — be decisive):
- Explore MINIMALLY: at most read ONE existing dashboard page + ONE existing entities/*.json as \
examples if present (use list_dir on `src/app/(app)/dashboard` and `entities`). Do NOT read the \
engine, registry, sdk or every ui component — they are fixed and correct.
- Then WRITE: declare every entity the user asked for, then write the screens. Spend most steps WRITING, not reading.
- Write ONE page per entity YOU declared in entities/*.json (at \
`src/app/(app)/dashboard/<entity>/page.tsx`). The template's example Task/Product are \
NOT the user's data — build pages for the entities the USER asked for, then remove or \
ignore the examples; do not loop building a `tasks` page for an app that has none.
- After your files are in, run `build` ONCE. ON A FAILED BUILD: the observation shows \
the EXACT file + error — make a TARGETED fix to THAT file/line (common causes: a custom \
column/prop passed to <CrudResource> — pass ONLY `entity` + optional title; a wrong \
import path; or an entity field type the engine rejects). NEVER re-issue write_file with \
the SAME content — an identical re-write fixes NOTHING; read the error and change exactly \
what it points at. Repeat build→fix until clean. THEN verify it actually RUNS: \
`runtime_check {"path":"/dashboard"}` — a typecheck-clean app can still 5xx on render. If it \
fails, `read_logs` to see the real runtime error, fix the named file, re-check. THEN `see` the \
main route: the vision judge returns CONCRETE design fixes (hero too small, 3 identical cards, \
weak contrast) — apply them so the page is not just working but genuinely good-looking. Call \
`done` ONLY after the build is clean, the route renders, AND `see` has no blocking issues.
- Never repeat an identical read OR an identical write. Never ask the user questions — \
decide and act. One action per reply."""

- This is a SURGICAL EDIT. Change the minimum. Do NOT regenerate entities/pages \
that already work. The engine, auth, RBAC, kit and globals are fixed template \
files — never touch them. To add a data section, add `entities/<Name>.json` + a \
page that renders <CrudResource entity="Name"/>.
- grep/read to find the exact spot, prefer edit_file (search must be copied \
byte-for-byte from what you read), build, fix, done.
- Be fast and minimal — a small edit needs only a few steps. One action per reply."""

WORK STYLE: explore MINIMALLY, spend most steps WRITING, never repeat an identical \
read or write, never ask the user questions — decide and act. When an EXTERNAL library's \
API bites you (a build error about a wrong signature, a renamed export, a removed option), \
call `docs` for that library BEFORE guessing — current docs beat a stale memory. When you author tests, \
run them with bash. After the build is clean, `runtime_check` the main route(s) — a \
typecheck-clean app can still crash on render; if it 5xx, `read_logs`, fix, re-check. \
For an INTERACTIVE feature (send a message, save, submit a form, log in), a clean build \
and a 200 page do NOT prove it works — the real failure is a 4xx on the user's POST that \
a screenshot can never show. After editing one, `read_logs` and look for a 4xx/5xx with \
its reason — the server logs the EXACT cause (e.g. a rejected/mismatched field); fix until \
the action's own request is 2xx, not just until the page loads. PROVE it with `probe`: \
perform the real action as a logged-in user (e.g. probe POST to create a resource, then \
probe POST to act on it) and require a 2xx with the expected body before `done`. \
For any OWNED data (records a user creates and others must not see), scope EVERY query \
by the authenticated user (the session user id) — never return rows the current user \
does not own, and protect every data route with auth. Then PROVE it with `verify_isolation` \
on that resource: a green build and a working create do NOT prove that another user can't \
read it. Fix until isolation passes before `done`. \
Then `see` the main route — the vision judge returns concrete design fixes; apply them \

# ── Nested-layout sanitizer (harness-hardening, deterministic) ──────────────
#
# In Next.js App Router ONLY the root `src/app/layout.tsx` may render <html>/
# <body>; a nested group layout (e.g. `src/app/(app)/layout.tsx`) that also emits
# them produces a duplicate <html>/<body>, which BREAKS React hydration — and a
# broken hydration kills every client component, including the realtime
# `useChannel` hook, so messages silently stop arriving. The thin-base design
# directive asks the model to restyle `(app)/layout.tsx`, and a weak model adds
# <html><body> there even when told not to (observed live twice). A prompt can't
# guarantee this; the engine can. Strip the offending wrapper on write — a nested
# layout NEVER legitimately contains <html>/<head>/<body>, so this only ever fixes
# a real bug. Code-level kill switch below (no config plumbing into the executor).

# can't guarantee ordering; the engine can. On write, hoist every @import to the
# top (after an optional @charset), preserving their order. A file whose imports
# are already correctly placed is returned byte-identical.
# NB: match to the `;` at END OF LINE, not the first `;` — a Google-Fonts
# @import URL carries inner semicolons (`wght@400;500;600;700`), and a `[^;{}]*`
