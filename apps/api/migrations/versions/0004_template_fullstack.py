"""allow 'fullstack' as a project template

The original CHECK constraint added in migration 0002 listed only V1
static templates. V2 Phase A introduces a `fullstack` template (Next.js
+ Postgres + Drizzle, runs in an orchestrator-managed dev container) and
its INSERTs need to pass the CHECK. We DROP and re-ADD the constraint
with the expanded allowlist; both operations are fast even on large
tables because Postgres rewrites only the constraint metadata.
